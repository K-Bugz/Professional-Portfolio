                <p>
                    Originally from Illinois, I have made a new home here in Austin Texas. I enjoy being with my family,
                    chess, mathematics, computers, coding, coffee, pens, music, and sports.
                    <br><br>
                    I have spent the last decade teaching mathematics and computer science. Molding young minds is a
                    rewarding job that has given me memories and frienships forever. Now, I am pusuing my dreams and
                    going into
                    coding.
                    <br><br>
                    Coding provides a nice mix of problem solving, math, and creativeness that makes me excited to learn
                    and express
                    myself. Currently, I am more interesting in backend design but, have grown found of learning
                    front-end design.

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        I love the dynamic and ease of the Pythonic syntax. As a teacher of Python,
                        I have seen how easy it is to learn and wield. I believe Python will assert itself
                        in the near future as the dominate language.
                        Currently, my favorite Python projects are as follows:<br>
                        1) Guessing games<br>
                        2) Simple RPG<br>
                        3) QR code maker<br>

                    <h3>Html</h3>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most usesfull language. Currently, I use it to make some
                        websites and to display information on my retropi player. As a coder,
                        I recognize that HTML most likely effects our daily life the most. I
                        currently find more passion in backend dev but, do appreciate some HTML.

                <img src="./assets/images/CSS.png" alt="CSS logo" height="100" width="100" />

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Html would be utterly boring without CSS. CSS allows me to fullfill my creativeness
                        and image how much I can edit and change up my text. <br>
                        I also enjoy thinking how different viewports will effect my sights and problem solve
                        how I envision optimizing this.
